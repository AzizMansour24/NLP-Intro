## ðŸ§¼ Text Preprocessing

Fundamental steps to clean and prepare raw text for analysis:

- **Lowercasing**  
  Convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.

- **Removing Stop Words**  
  Eliminate common words (like "the", "and", "is") that add little value.

- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**  
  Extract or clean specific text patterns using `re.search`, `re.sub`, etc.

- **Tokenization**  
  Split text into individual words or tokens.

- **Stemming**  
  Reduce words to their root forms (e.g., "running" â†’ "run").

- **Lemmatization**  
  More accurate root-word extraction using context-aware algorithms.

- **N-Grams**  
  Create sequences of N items (words or characters) to capture context.

## ðŸ”Ž POS Tagging & Named Entity Recognition

- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**  
  Label each word with its grammatical role using tools like `nltk` or `spaCy`.

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
  Identify proper names, dates, locations, etc., using `spaCy`'s NER pipeline.

---

## ðŸ“Š Sentiment Analysis

Understand the emotional tone of the text using:

- **TextBlob**  
  Quick polarity and subjectivity scoring.

- **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)**  
  Rule-based model optimized for social media text.

---

## ðŸ§® Vectorizing Text

Convert text into numerical format for machine learning:

- **Bag of Words (BoW)**  
  Represents text by word frequency in a fixed vocabulary.

- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)**  
  Weights words by frequency across documents to emphasize importance.

---

## ðŸ“š Topic Modeling

Discover hidden thematic structures in text:

- **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**  
  Probabilistic model that assigns topics to words.

- **LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis)**  
  Decomposes term-document matrix to reveal relationships between terms and topics.
